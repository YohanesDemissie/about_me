Today I learned how a lot of functions. I learned how to prompt questionnaires with limited trials. I learned how to tally questions answers at the end of the questionnaires. I learned to create custom prompts based on users input. I learned to create a guessing game stored within an array. I also had a little more practice utilizing the terminal; changing directories, utilizing "ls" and pushing directories into repositories. I understand a about the branch and master system but will know more about it with experience.
